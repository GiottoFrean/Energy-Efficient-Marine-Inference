# LowLightInference
Thoughts and experiments for observing deep-sea creatures and performing inference with minimal disturbance.

- **A - Species inference from movement acoustics.ipynb**: Brief experiments on inferring species from movement and acoustic signatures; includes synthetic examples and visualization.

- **B - Location optimisation with Gaussian Processes.ipynb**: Uses Gaussian Process models to optimise sensor/observer placement over time; shows GP progression and acquisition behavior.

- **C - Distributed event inference with communication costs.ipynb**: Studies event detection across sensor arrays with communication cost considerations; contains signal/noise examples and scoring grids.

- **D - Location optimization with an energy budget.ipynb**: Extends location optimisation to include energy/budget constraints, showing trade-offs between exploration and cost.
