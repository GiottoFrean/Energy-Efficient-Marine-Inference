# Energy-Efficient Marine Inference

Obtaining accurate data on deep-ocean species and their population dynamics is a fundamental challenge in marine science. The natural solution is to deploy autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) capable of long-term operation in remote environments. Beyond the problems of pressure and corrosion, such systems must address two core questions:

1. How can species be reliably identified?
2. How can this be done over long time periods with energy constraints?

Today, species identification in the deep ocean is typically performed using video cameras paired with artificial lighting. The system is dropped for a few days and left to record, before being pulled back up. Not only is this approach is energy-intensive, but the artificial lighting disturbs some species and alters natural behaviour, biasing observations.

This project explores whether passive acoustics can provide a viable alternative. The core idea is to use the sound generated by animal movement to infer species presence, which doesn't require illumination. Deployment would involve an initial calibration phase during which recordings would need to be paired with visual labels, followed by extended autonomous operation relying solely on acoustic data.

Successfully deploying such a system raises additional challenges. To collect data requires positioning sensors in regions of high animal activity, yet sampling the environment is costly. To sample a large space means repeatedly moving the AUVs by boat, while local underwater searches requrie energy for movement. Communication bandwidth is also severely limited. As a result we need to explore energy-efficient methods for inference.

This repository contains a collection of exploratory notebooks. Together, they amount to a brief study of energy-efficient marine inference, spanning sensing, constrained optimization, and distributed decision-making. A brief overview of each notebook is given below.

## A - Species Inference from Movement Acoustics

This notebook explores whether acoustic signatures generated by animal movement near a hydrophone array can be used to infer species presence. I create simple synthetic creatures use their simulated acoustic responses to train a basic classifier as a proof-of-concept.

This approach avoids disturbing light-sensitive animals and eliminates the need for energy-intensive lighting, making it suitable for long-term autonomous monitoring.

## B - Location Optimization with Gaussian Processes

This notebook provides an overview of Gaussian Process (GP) based optimization, emphasizing its efficiency in sample usage. In the above context each deployment to sample animal density in a region requires a costly raising and lowering of equipment.

## C - Distributed Event Inference with Communication Costs

Here, I do a slight pivot to study event detection in a network of stationary receivers operating in a noisy environment. For some species like whales observing them close-up is unlikely. Multiple agents might need to communicate to do reliable detection.

I compare:
- A standard centralized aggregation approach, and  
- A communication-efficient variant where nodes perform local inference and only transmit when a confidence threshold is exceeded.

The latter requires handling accidental or spurious triggers.

## D - Location Optimization with an Explicit Energy Budget

This notebook extends the GP-based optimization demonstrated in B by explicitly incorporating energy constraints. While GP optimization is sample-efficient, movement between locations is a significant cost for any UAV.

I briefly review using mutual information for planning movement and then demonstrate that down-weighting expected improvement based on travel distance can improve the performance of an energy-constrained optimizer.

## E - Optimization with Rare Events

This notebook addresses the challenge of navigating toward regions with high event rates when the underlying function is unobserved. In reality we never observe the true animal density, we have to infer, and then optimize it. 

The problem can be framed as inference over an inhomogeneous Poisson process, or a kind of continuous multi-armed bandit problem. I test an approach where observed events are converted into an events-per-unit-time signal along the robot's path, which is then used to reconstruct the full spatial intensity function.
