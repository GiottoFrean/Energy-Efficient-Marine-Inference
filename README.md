# Energy-Efficient Marine Inference

This repository contains a collection of notebooks exploring energy-efficient machine learning and sensing strategies for low-disturbance marine observation. The focus is on approaches that minimize expensive resources such as movement, communication, and lighting. Below is an overview of each notebook:

Each notebook focuses on a distinct inference or optimization problem motivated by autonomous or long-duration marine deployments.

## A — Species Inference from Movement Acoustics

**Notebook:** `A - Species inference from movement acoustics.ipynb`

This notebook explores whether **acoustic signatures generated by animal movement** near a hydrophone array can be used to infer species presence. Using simple synthetic creatures and simulated acoustic responses, I train a basic classifier to distinguish species based solely on movement-induced sound.

This approach avoids disturbing light-sensitive animals and eliminates the need for energy-intensive lighting, making it suitable for long-term autonomous monitoring.

## B — Location Optimization with Gaussian Processes

**Notebook:** `B - Location optimization with Gaussian Processes.ipynb`

This notebook provides an overview of **Gaussian Process (GP)–based optimization**, emphasizing its efficiency in sample usage. In a marine context, each sample (e.g. animal density, chemical concentration) may require raising and lowering equipment, making sample efficiency critical.

## C — Distributed Event Inference with Communication Costs

**Notebook:** `C - Distributed event inference with communication costs.ipynb`

Here, I study **event detection in a network of stationary receivers** operating in a noisy environment—e.g. detecting whale calls using a spatially distributed hydrophone grid.

I compare:
- A standard centralized aggregation approach, and  
- A communication-efficient variant where nodes perform local inference and only transmit when a confidence threshold is exceeded.

Special care is required to handle accidental or spurious triggers during aggregation.

## D — Location Optimization with an Explicit Energy Budget

**Notebook:** `D - Location optimization with an energy budget.ipynb`

This notebook extends the GP-based location optimization from **Notebook B** by explicitly incorporating **energy or battery constraints**. While GP optimization is sample-efficient, movement between locations may dominate total energy expenditure.

I explore:
- Information-theoretic acquisition functions, and  
- Methods for down-weighting expected improvement based on travel distance.

## E — Optimization with Rare Events

**Notebook:** `E - Optimization with rare events.ipynb`

This notebook addresses the challenge of navigating toward regions with **high event rates** when the underlying function is unobserved. A motivating example is an autonomous robot attempting to locate the area of highest animal density when it only observes discrete events (e.g. detections or encounters).

The problem can be framed as inference over an **inhomogeneous Poisson process**, closely related to a continuous multi-armed bandit. I test an approach where observed events are converted into an events-per-unit-time signal along the robot’s path, which is then used to reconstruct the full spatial intensity function.
